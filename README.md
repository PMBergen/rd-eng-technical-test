# Palfinger technical test

Welcome to Palfinger technical test and congratulations to reach this step in the hiring process.

## Objectives of the test

It is two fold, you should go through the documentation and the implementation and find gaps in both code and requirements.

- Documentation review: Go through the documentation in Documentation.md and find where it could be extended or corrected.
- Code review: Go through the code, understanding what it does and suggest ways to improve it, things like: patterns, file organization, more functional flavour, bad handling of edge cases, clear bugs, etc... in general, things that you think are important in a code base.
- Suggest unit tests that could be interesting given the documentation and the current implementation.

We are expecting **around 2 hours of work on the test**, if you find yourself expending more time you are probably over doing it.

## Non objectives of the test

- We do not require deep understanding of OPC-UA so don't focus on that part of the technology, it is a rabbit hole.
- Don't focus on performance, if you can find simple performance gains it is ok, but don't invest too much time on it.
- No implementation needed, just a clear explanation of the changes you would do is also good enough.

## Handing in your assessment

- All answers should be written in the notes.md file included in the repository
- You are not expected to place comments or other notes anywhere else. You are free to write elsewhere but only notes.md will be looked at
